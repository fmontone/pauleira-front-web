# Pauleira Front Web

This is a website buutstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and It's part of a initial project made for Pauleira Guitars, that I'm building together with a backend in NodeJs and a Front End Admin.

The idea is to create a strong base for escalating and add features in the future.

## How to run

For now you can run this project as stand alone SPA, this way (note: I use Yarn for packaging but feel free to run with NPM as well):

- Clone it from this repo
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn dev` and it should run in dev mod in port 3000
- Run `yarn build` and then `yarn start` to execute in production mode

This is enough to run this project on your browser and navigate thru it`s front end basically on port 3000 as create-react-app defaults.

## Contact Info

I'm a front end developer mainly, and sometimes I can put myself in risc by acting as fullstack developer with React & NodeJs. I'm also a designer as well, and you can contact me by email: [montone@gmail.com](mailto:montone@gmail.com)
